The `recipe_finder.py` script is a Python application that uses the Spoonacular API to find recipes based on a list of ingredients provided by the user. It asks for ingredients as input, queries the API for recipes that use these ingredients, and prints out a list of up to 5 recipes, including their names and links to detailed instructions. The script demonstrates basic usage of the `requests` library to perform API calls and handle responses.
